**This guide assumes that the new HDD is already formatted. It should be formatted as a GPT drive with a fs type of ext4. Ideally it should be labeled with the HDD serial number. See format_new_hdd.txt**

1) Write down Serial Number of new HDD

2) Physically add new HDD to server

3) Make the HDD is found by the server

ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/ata-* | grep -i <HDD_SERIAL_NUMBER>
(the serial number should be within the HDD id)

4) Find which VM you want to add it to by listing all current VMs

qm list

5) Pass HDD to VM

# qm set VM_ID  VIRTIO_NUMBER    HDD_ID_TO_PASS
  qm set  100    -virtio<num>    /dev/disk/by-id/<HDD ID>

Example:
qm set 100 -virtio2 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3000DM001-1CH166_Z1F4B19R
