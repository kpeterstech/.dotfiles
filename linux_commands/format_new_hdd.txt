**This guide assumes that the new disk is located at /dev/sdb. This might not be the same location during reboots**

**Make sure you have "parted" installed on your machine**

sudo apt update
sudo apt install parted

**Identify New Disk on the System**
sudo parted -l | grep Error

	or

lsblk -f (will show you disks in a tree)

**Set Partition Standard**

sudo parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt

**Create the New Partition**

sudo parted -a opt /dev/sdb mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%

**Create Filesystem on the New Partition**

sudo mkfs.ext4 -L <name for the partition> /dev/sdb1

*If you want to add a name make sure to include -L and then the name
*make sure you choose the actual partition and not the disk. The disk in this example is sdb. The partition is sdb1
**Edit the partition label**

sudo e2label /dev/sdb1 newlabel

**Immediatly Mount New Drive**

sudo mount -o defaults /dev/sdb1 /mnt/<location>

**Mount File System on Boot**

sudo vim /etc/fstab

# The colums that are needed when adding a drive to fstab
# HDD Identifier	Mounting location	FS type	   Mount Options	dump Option	fs check
UUID=<UUID GOES HERE>	/mnt/<location>		ext4	   defaults		0		2
