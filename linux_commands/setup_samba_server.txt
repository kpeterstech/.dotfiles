This process was done with ubuntu server 16.04

- install ubuntu server 16.04

- find out what the current ip address and broadcast address of the machine is
`ifconfig`

- after install create static ip address
`sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces`

- change your eth0 from dhcp to static. It should look like the following

`auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
 address 192.168.1.252 <whatever you want>
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 broadcast 192.168.1.255 <what you copied down from ifconfig>
 gateway 192.168.1.1 <most likely, could also be 192.168.2.1>
`

- restart your networking
`/etc/init.d/networking restart`

- update and upgrade the machine
`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`

- install the following packages
`sudo apt install openssh-server samba smbclient cifs-utils ntp ntpdate`

- create the directories that you want to share
`mkdir /files`
`mkdir /files/share`

- give the folders full permission
`chmod 777 -R /files`

- edit the samba config file
`sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf`

- add your directory info at the bottom. The format is:
[Broadcast Name]
 comment = <name>
 path = <path to directory>
 browseable = <yes/no>
 read only = <yes/no>

 Example:
 [storage_pool]
  path = /mnt/pool
  browseable = yes
  read only = no

- create a samba username and password
`sudo smbpasswd -a <username>`

- restart the computer
`sudo reboot`

- Connecting to the server from another linux machine. Fist edit the fstab
`sudo vim /etc/fstab`

- at the bottom place the following
`//IP-ADDRESS/BROADCASTNAME /mount/location cifs uid=1000,gid=1000,credentials=$HOME/.network_pw,iocharset=utf8 0 0`

Example:
`//192.168.0.123/storage_pool /mount/location cifs uid=1000,gid=1000,credentials=$HOME/.network_pw,iocharset=utf8 0 0`

- cd to home directory
`cd $HOME`

- create a new file that will store your samba user name and password
`vim .network_pw`

- type in the username and password. Each on their own line with no spaces
username=user
password=drowssap

- mount the samba share
`sudo mount -a`
