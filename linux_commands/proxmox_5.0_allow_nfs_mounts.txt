in order to allow nfs mounts in a proxmox container you need to edit the following files

- cd /etc/apparmor.d/lxc

add the following to lxc-defaults and lxc-default-cgns

`
# allow nfs mount everywhere
mount fstype=rpc_pipefs,
mount fstype=nfs,
`

- /etc/init.d/apparmor reload

restart the containers and you should now be able to add nfs mounts
