**Grouping**
You can use "()" to group patterns. To use those patterns in the renaming portion you use $1, $2, etc for the number of groupings you have

rename 's/(firstName) - (lastName)/$2 - $1/'

(firstName) - this would group whatever pattern is matched between these first parens "()"
(lastName) - Same as (firstName) but for a different grouping
$2 - this matches the second grouping. In this case (lastName)
$1 - this matches the first grouping. In this case (firstName)

The above command would switch firstName and lastName positions

**Negative Lookahed**
You can use a negative lookahead to find patterns that you do not want to match. You do this with parens "()" then a ?! then the pattern you dont want to match.

Example: You want to find words where the letter "q" is NOT followed by a "u"

q(?!u)

the lookahead parens do not act as grouping. However you can place any other other regular expression or groupings within the lookahead

**Positive Lookahed**
Same as a negative lookahead but you use an equal sign "=" instead of an exclamation point "!"

Example: You want to find words where the letter "q" is followd by a "u"

q(?=u)
