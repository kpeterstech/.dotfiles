StyleSheetCommands:
--------------------
open up the keymap.cson (under "edit" > "keymaps")

to create new files from the editor add this file to the end of the keymap options

'body':
  'ctrl-alt-n': 'tree-view:add-file'

this allows you to press "ctrl-alt-n" to create a new file

> For working with python3.6 make sure to have flake8, flake8-docstrings and flake8-pep257
installed for linter to work. If you get a D100, D103 error just ignore them under the
linter
