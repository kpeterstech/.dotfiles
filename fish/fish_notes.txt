**FISH DOCUMENTATION**
https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html

**POWERLINE**
If you have powerline installed on your machine and have problems with it showing up within tmux try running this
command in fish.

powerline-config tmux setup; tmux

This command might need to be run after every system restart. In order to solve this problem the following solution might be helpful. Place this in your "config.fish" file

if string match -q 'screen*' -- $TERM
	powerline-config tmux setup
end

**FIND COMMAND**
When using -exec with the find command you need to place the curly brace in single quotes.
Example:
	find . -type f -exec cp '{}' test/ \;
this is because in fish using the {} does brace expansion. You need to put it in single quotes so no errors
will occur

**ALIASES**
to create aliases like you would with bash/zsh all you need to type is the following:
alias <command>='<what you want command to be>'

after you do this run:
funcsave <command>

funcsave will save the command and allow you to use it in any other fish instance/future instance.
What funcsave does is it saves the command as a function in ~/.config/fish/functions. If you navigate
to that directory you will see there is a new file called <command>.fish. Inside that file is the
alias you created. You can manually create functions as you need them/want them. Once you have manually created the function with the format of <name>.fish you can call the function by typing <name> into the terminal.

Example:

alias mp4='vlc *.mp4'
funcsave mp4
*a new file called mp4.fish is saved in ~/.config/fish/functions*

cat ~/.config/fish/functions/mp4.fish

# Defined in - @ line 0
function mp4 --description 'alias mp4=vlc *.mp4'
	vlc *.mp4 $argv;
end

**COMMANDS**
- dirh: Shows the last 25 directories you were in. The highlighted directory is the current one you are in. You
	can select a previous directory with "prevd <number>" or a more recent directory with "nextd <number".
	You can also move forward/backward in the listed dirs by using <alt-leftarrow> and <alt-rightarrow>

- cdh: Similar to dirh, but just lists recent directories. It allows you to quickly switch to the desired dir
	by entering in either the letter/number that is next to the dir name
