**FISH DOCUMENTATION**
https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html

**FIND COMMAND**
When using -exec with the find command you need to place the curly brace in single quotes.
Example:
	find . -type f -exec cp '{}' test/ \;
this is because in fish using the {} does brace expansion. You need to put it in single quotes so no errors
will occur

**ALIASES**
to create aliases like you would with bash/zsh all you need to type is the following:
alias <command>='<what you want command to be>'

after you do this run:
funcsave <command>

funcsave will save the command and allow you to use it in any other fish instance/future instance.
What funcsave does is it saves the command as a function in ~/.config/fish/functions. If you navigate
to that directory you will see there is a new file called <command>.fish. Inside that file is the
alias you created. You can manually create functions as you need them/want them. Once you have manually created the function with the format of <name>.fish you can call the function by typing <name> into the terminal.

Example:

alias mp4='vlc *.mp4'
funcsave mp4
*a new file called mp4.fish is saved in ~/.config/fish/functions*

cat ~/.config/fish/functions/mp4.fish

# Defined in - @ line 0
function mp4 --description 'alias mp4=vlc *.mp4'
	vlc *.mp4 $argv;
end
